    <ol>
        <li>Step 1
            <p>Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C). Line a roasting pan with aluminum foil.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>Step 2
            <p>Mix chili powder, adobo seasoning, cumin, brown sugar, and cinnamon together in a small bowl until well
                combined. Add olive oil and stir until completely saturated.</p>
        </li>
        <li>Step 3
            <p>Pat pork dry with paper towels. Rub pork all over with spice mixture, then place into the prepared
                roasting pan.</p>
        </li>
        <li>Step 4
            <p>Cook in the preheated oven until pork is dark golden brown, about 35 minutes. An instant-read thermometer
                inserted into the center should read at least 145 degrees F (63 degrees C).</p>
        </li>
        <li>Step 5
            <p>Transfer pork to a platter and tent with foil to keep warm. Let rest for 10 to 15 minutes before slicing.
            </p>

            <p>Serve with accumulated juices.</p>
