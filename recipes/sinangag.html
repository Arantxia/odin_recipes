    <p>
        You can make this super-delicious Filipino coconut garlic fried rice (sinangag) mostly ahead of time because you
        need the steamed rice to cool and dry out a bit before you fry it. The final result is addictive and goes with
        everything on this menu, so I like to make two batches—one plain and one with the optional turmeric—which adds a
        little extra flavor and a pretty orange color.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 cups uncooked jasmine rice</li>
        <li>1 ½ cups water</li>
        <li>½ (15 ounce) can unsweetened coconut cream</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons ground turmeric (Optional)</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons coconut oil</li>
        <li>¼ cup finely chopped garlic</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons fish sauce</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Cooking Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Step 1</strong>
            <p>Place rice in a large bowl with enough water to cover by a few inches; swirl with your fingers, then drain. Repeat until water runs clear, about 3 times.</p>
        </li>
        <li> <strong>Step 2</strong>
            <p>Combine rice, 1 1/2 cups water, coconut cream, turmeric, and salt in a saucepan; bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer, covered, until rice is tender and liquid is absorbed, about 20 minutes. Chill, uncovered, 2 to 4 hours or overnight.</p>
        </li>
        <li> <strong>Step 3</strong>
            <p>Heat coconut oil in a 12-inch skillet or wok over high heat. Add garlic; cook until it just begins to brown, about 1 minute. Add rice and spread in an even layer; cook, without stirring, until lightly browned and crisp on the bottom, about 4 minutes. Add fish sauce; cook, stirring, until fully combined and heated through, about 2 minutes.</p>
        </li>

    </ol>
